### Here Comes The Great Tips and Tricks!

?Class = Show Key information on functions you have unpacked already ??Class = Show Key Information On Functions usage and arguments if you don't have it.

###Mean and Counting Tricks##

1:5 is the same as 1,2,3,4,5 rep(x , y) x = Value , Y = instances , Rep = Repetition

```{r}
rep(4 , 6)
vector1 <- c(1 , 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6 )
vector2 <- c(1:6)
vector1 
vector2 
"The difference is the syntax its faster to do 1:6 than 1 , 2 , ... "
```

c() = combines values into a vector or a list (VECTOR) C( 1 , 2 , 3 )

```{r}
My_number <- c(1, 92, 182)
My_number
"We can Change the Vector using this My_number[2] <- 'two' "
My_number[2] <- "two"
"Lets see, background realness darling" 
My_number
"Remember when we add quotation marks to any Vectors the entire range becomes Strings & or Characters"

```

as.numeric() , as.character()

```{r}
"Since R is an interesting language we learned that it does not typecast nor conatonate" 
as.numeric(My_number)
"See if we have the string two instead of 2 an interger it doesn't work lets edit that out! "
My_number[2] <- 2 
as.numeric(My_number)
"Huzzah we did it! "
```

Mean

```{r}
Trim()  = Data cleaning process rep(0,11) = Repetition the value to the left repeated however many times to the right Trim() is very confusing. What the hell.
```

Sample function is random selection Sample (x , size , replacem prob Prob = Rep (â…™ , 6)
