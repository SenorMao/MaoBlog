Write your blog around the three big themes:\n\n# 1. Data types: Show that you understand what is available to you in R. Note also, this goal overlaps with part of the midterm project. See the appendix on Data Types in the textbook for help. Write notes and R code chunks to demonstrate your knowledge\n\nThe Types of data we can do is very simple, we have numeric data, ordinal data, assignment data types , we see Boolean which is essentially prompting the code to check if an assignment or condition is true We also have while loops, if functions, and so many more! Don't forget about Vector!\n\n```{r}\na <- 1 \na \ntypeof(a)\nis.integer(a)\n\n\n b <- integer(length = 5)\nis.integer(b)\nlubridate::today()\n```\n\n```{r}\ntypeof(TRUE)\nclass(FALSE)\nis.logical(1)\nas.logical(0)\nlogical(length = 5)\n```\n\n###Vectors\n\n```{r}\none_things <- 1 \ntwo_things <- c(1,2)\nthree_things <- c(1:5)\n\n\n{a = 0}\nwhile (a < 5){\n  \n  print(\"seems we are still under 5\")\n  \n  a = a + 1\n}\n\n```\n\nWe did it we went over the loop `r a` times\n\n# 2. Tidy Data: Show that you understand what this means. Give an example of data this is in tidy format, and data that is not.\n\n### data.frame\n\n```{r}\nmy_df <- data.frame( a = 1:5,\n                     b = c(\"one\",\"two\",\"three\",\"four\",\"five\"),\n                     random = runif(5,0,1))\n#print to see\nmy_df\nmy_df$a == 1:5\nmy_df$b\n##access rows \nmy_df[1,] #row 1, all columns\nmy_df[,1] # columns, all rows \nmy_df[1:2,] # rows 1 to 2, all columns\nmy_df[1:2,3] #rows 1 to 2 , but only for column 3 \n```\n\nvectors cant have mixed data types Lists can have different data types and object types: Vector, data.frame , lists et.\n\nlists\n\n{layout-ncol=2} \\### List One\n\n-   Item A\n-   Item B\n-   Item C\n\n### List Two\n\n-   Item X\n-   Item Y\n-   Item Z ::\n\n3.  ggplot2: We will continue learning about this across the semester. Show at a minimum that you can make a graph and add it to your blog. Try examples from the textbook. Show that you understand the layer concept. Identify aspects that are confusing to you so we can discuss them in class.\n\n##ggplot2 - Grammar of Graphics \\| aes (Aestetics)\n\n```{r}\nsurvey_data <- read_csv(\"https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v2/data/survey_data.csv\")\n#Blank page\nggplot()\n#x and Y values \nggplot(data = survey_data, \n       mapping = aes(x= wait_time, \n                     y= satisfaction))\n\n\n#time \nggplot(data = survey_data, \n              aes(x= wait_time, \n                  y= satisfaction)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"black\", size=5)+ \n    geom_point(color = \"pink\", size=4)+\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n    \n    \n##Summon CSV and put it into Survey_data\nggplot(data = survey_data, \n      aes(x= wait_time, \n          y= satisfaction, \n          color = satisfaction,\n          size = satisfaction))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\nmin(survey_data$wait_time)\nmax(survey_data$wait_time)\nlength(survey_data$wait_time)\n\nggplot(data=survey_data, mapping = aes(x= wait_time))+\n  geom_histogram(bins=50 , color=\"green\")\n\n```\n\nThis doesn't have any layers, it's just one big ol' empty graph, above we are able to see all the beautiful graphs that have different layers to provide more information such as an index and color!\n\nFill is the inside of the shape Dv = dependent variable dv_SEs Geom_errorbar(aes(x = , y = ))\n\n```{r}\n\nggplot(survey_data, aes(x = wait_time)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, \n                 boundary = 0, \n                 fill = \"white\", \n                 color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Wait time (seconds)\",\n                     breaks = seq(0, 600, 60))\n```\n\nBonus Histogram for myself +\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"mint","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Week 4 Assignment","author":"Emmanel Pascual","toc-title":"Contents","date":"2023-03-22","categories":["Week","Number","Four"],"image":"cheatCode.avif"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
