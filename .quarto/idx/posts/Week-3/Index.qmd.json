Be able to make a new .qmd document Sign top left Create new Quarto Document\n\n-   Save \\> Find the posts -\\> Only use Source Editor -\\>\n\n-   Files tab make Quarto Doc it makes it in the folder you're in and they're blank\n\n-   Top level, it gives reference to what the post is about \\# Render QMD Documnent\n\n2.  Be able to render a .qmd document!\n\n-   Yes We can render the whole website too! Render a page from the console using commands.\n\n# Differences in Source Editor and Visual Editor\n\n3.  Explain the difference between the source editor view and visual editor view in Rstudio\n\n-   Source View is plain test (ASCII character will be expressed exactly as it is in the source view)\n\n-   Visual View Renders the plain text and interprets it as Markdown text, it gives the text formatting text instead of the plain test.\n\n# Simple Markdown\n\n4.  Be able to insert simple markdown plain text (headers, lists, paragraphs), and render the document.\n\nHeaders:\n\n# Header 1\n\n## Header 2\n\n### Header 3\n\n#### Header 4\n\n##### Header 5\n\n###### Header 6\n\nThe smaller we get the smaller the header will end up being.\n\nLists:\n\n*-* **unordered list** + sub-item 1 + sub-item 2 - sub-sub-item 1\n\n-   unordered list\n    -   sub-item 1\n    -   sub-item 2\n        -   sub-sub-item 1\n\n*italics* and **bold**\n\nPlain text End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph. *italics* and *italics* **bold** and **bold** superscript^2^ ~~strikethrough~~\n\n| Right | Left | Default | Center |\n|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|\n|    12 | 12   | 12      |   12   |\n|   123 | 123  | 123     |  123   |\n|     1 | 1    | 1       |   1    |\n\n$E = mc^{2}$\n\n$$E = mc^{2}$$\n\nWe can make Neat Diagrams:\n\n5.  Be aware of resources to help you learn more about markdown options.\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html\n\n# Inserting R Code Chunk\n\n6.  Be able to insert an R code chunk, and show the output in the rendered document.\n\n-   *macro for quick insert ctrl - alt - I*\n\n```{R}\n  summonMe <- c(1, 2, 3 , 4:6)\n  summonMe\n```\n\n# Run that Code!\\~\n\n7.  Running R code chunks in a qmd\n\n-   pressing play\n-   copy/paste into console\n-   highlight then command-enter (mac)\n-   precedence issues (first to last)\n\n```{R}\nname <- \"Emily\"\nage <- 36\ntoday <- Sys.Date()\nchristmas <- as.Date(\"2023-12-25\")\n```\n\n# Special Code Chunk Options\n\n8.  Be aware of R code chunk options, and how to use eval, messages, error, warning, and echo.\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html\n\neval - Evaluate the code chunk (if false, just echos the code into the output).\n\necho - Include the source code in output\n\n```{R, echo = FALSE}\n\nprint(\"Will we be able to see this?\") \n\nanswer <- \"yes\"\n\nanswer\n\n```\n\noutput -Include the results of executing the code in the output (true, false, or asis to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quarto's standard enclosing markdown). warning Include warnings in the output.\n\nerror -Include errors in the output (note that this implies that errors executing code will not halt processing of the document).\n\ninclude - Catch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. include: false suppresses all output from the code block).\n\n```{R}\nprint(\"https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html\n\")\n\n\n```\n\n9.  Be able to set code chunk options per chunk, and/or for the whole document. Understand rules for precedence (which options will apply if both are set.)\n\nSo we can see that if we put echo in the very top it will take precedent of all R chunks but if we put it in the code chunk it will only do so in selected options\"\n\n-   [Echo]{.underline}: If set to TRUE (default), the R code in the chunk will be printed in the output document. If set to FALSE, only the output (if any) will be printed.\n\n-   [Eval:]{.underline} If set to TRUE (default), the R code in the chunk will be evaluated and its output (if any) will be printed. If set to FALSE, the code will be skipped, but its text (if any) will be printed.\n\n-   [Error:]{.underline} If set to TRUE, errors generated by R while running the chunk will stop the rendering process and display an error message. If set to FALSE (default), errors will be treated as warnings and will not stop the rendering process. \"\n\n```{R, echo = FALSE}\na <- 10 \n\na\n```\n\n10. Write inline r code.\n\n```{R}\nname <- \"Emily\"\nage <- 36\ntoday <- Sys.Date()\nchristmas <- as.Date(\"2023-12-25\")\n\n```\n\n\"My name is `r name` and I am `r age` years old. It is `r christmas - today` days until Christmas, which is my favorite holiday.\"\n\n11. Explain how the rendering environment is different from the Rstudio environment.\n\n```{R}\nprint(\"The differences between the rendering eviornment and the Rstudio enviornment are the assignments of the variables. We can either define it outside or inside this specific code chunk.\")\n\nb <- 10\nc <- 35 \n\na <- c+b \n\na\n```\n\n12. Be aware of more advanced quarto options for html documents, and try some of the options.\n\nConsider it done!\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"output-file":"Index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"mint","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Week 3 Assignment","author":"Emmanel Pascual","toc-title":"Contents","date":"2023-02-21","categories":["Week","Number","Three"],"image":"Questions.jpg"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
