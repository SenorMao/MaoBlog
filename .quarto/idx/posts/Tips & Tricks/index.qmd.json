If you find that your code isn't working and you can't figure out why, it might be worth restarting your R session. This will clear the environment and detach all loaded packages - think of it like restarting your phone. There are several ways that you can restart R:\n\n-   Menu: **Session \\> Restart R**\n\n-   Cmd-Shift-F10 or Ctl-Shift-F10\n\n-   type `.rs.restartR()` in the console\n\n# Useful Functions\n\n```{}\n```\n\n### **Mean and Counting Tricks**\n\n-   [1:5:]{.underline} Instead of wasting valuable time typing out every number you could us \"1:5\" which is the same as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n-   [rep(x , y)]{.underline}: When looking to repeat a value multiple times I.E assigning arrays. rep(x , y) Rep = Repetition , X = Value , Y = Instances.\n\n```{r}\nYay <- rep(4 , 6)\nYay\nvector1 <- c(1 , 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6 )\nvector2 <- c((8:10))\nvector1\nvector2 \n```\n\n-   c() = combines values into a vector or a list (VECTOR) C( 1 , 2 , 3 )\n\n```{r}\nMy_number <- c(1, 92, 182)\nMy_number\nMy_number[2] <- \"two\"\nMy_number\n\n\n```\n\n#### Type Cast Tips and Tricks: \n\n1.  Unlike in Java where you are able to type cast a value and convert it into for instance a Double instead of a Integer,\n\n2.  R does not have the same principle it will use the below Functions to augment all the values into one of the same,.\n\n3.  usually this is Strings as seen in the example below.\n\n#### as.numeric() , as.character()\n\n```{r}\nMy_number <- 7 \nas.numeric(My_number)\nMy_number[1] <- 2 \nas.numeric(My_number)\n```\n\n## What is a TRIM() ???  I actually have no idea.  \"Trim = Data cleaning process rTrim() is very confusing. What the hell.\"\n\n```{r}\nnumbs <- 1:6\nmean(numbs)\nmean(numbs , .1 )\n\n```\n\n###  Assigning Probability (Dice Example \\| Sample() ) \n\nSample function is random selection\n\n-   Sample (x , size , replace = BOOLEAN, Prob = (X , Y ) ) When Sample makes a selection it wants to know what the probability is that's when the REP function comes into play.\n\n-   With the code below we assign a variable called Dice with an array of 1 through 6, we then utilize the Sample() function to roll the dice, here we must also set the probability and a nifty trick is to use the rep() function as well to not write 1/6 six different times.\n\n```{r}\ndice <- c(1:6)\ndice\nsample(dice, 6, replace = FALSE, prob = rep(1/6, 6))\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Tips and Tricks","author":"Emmanel Pascual","date":"2023-02-09","categories":["Data","Tips","Tricks"],"image":"cheatCode.avif"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
