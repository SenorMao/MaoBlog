Answering these questions (at a high level) is the focus of this analysis.\n\n\nWe will use the tidyverse, lubridate, and scales packages for data wrangling and visualization, and the DT package for interactive display of tabular output, and the unvotes package for the data.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(unvotes)\n\n\n\n\nThe data we’re using originally come from the unvotes package.
